                  The beachfront location, close proximity to the mountains, and natural topography at Rancho Costa Verde has created breathtaking 180-degree sea and mountain views from almost every home. Rancho Costa Verde offers 1/4-acre home sites starting as low as $22,500.00 and custom home construction from $120 per square foot.

                  Rancho Costa Verde is a master planned development that has made maintaining the natural beauty of Baja California a top priority. Our master plan was designed with our amazing views in mind. Our community was created with staggered lot lines so your neighbors will never impact your view, green belts to maintain that “open feeling,” and with 40 percent of the land dedicated as an ecological preserve for the continued enjoyment of the beauty of this real estate on The Sea of Cortes.
